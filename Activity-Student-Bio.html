        I live in Brooklyn, NY currently, although I am originally from St. Louis, MO. I graduated from UNC Wilmington in 2012 with Recreation Therapy degree with a minor in Psychology. I never pursed that degree after my internship and just have been bartending until i figured out what i really wanted a career in.
